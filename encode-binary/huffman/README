A huffman coding library and command line interface to the library. The encoder is a 2 pass encoder. The first pass generates a huffman tree and the second pass encodes the data. The decoder is one pass and uses a huffman code table at the beginning of the compressed file to decode the data.

libhuffman has functions for encoding and decoding both files and memory.

libhuffman and huffcode are released under a BSD license.
