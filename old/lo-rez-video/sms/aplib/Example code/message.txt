This message has been
compressed with aPLib. It
is a demonstration of how to
decompress small blocks of
data into RAM.

It compresses from 329 bytes
down to 242 bytes, compression
of 27%. That's not much
because it's a small file so
there are less opportunities
for data matching. For
comparison, Zip compresses it
to 220 bytes.
