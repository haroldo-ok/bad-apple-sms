The font for this demo has been
compressed with aPLib, from 3072
to 615 bytes (compression of
80%). Zip can compress it to 513
bytes. This is somewhat extreme
because it's only 1bpp font
data, though.

It requires some work to
adjust the decompressor to work
with VRAM, because it has both
read and write VRAM, which is a
real hassle on the SMS. Luckily,
it never uses the same code for
reading from thr source (ROM)
and reading from the destination
(VRAM) so it's easier than it
might have been.
